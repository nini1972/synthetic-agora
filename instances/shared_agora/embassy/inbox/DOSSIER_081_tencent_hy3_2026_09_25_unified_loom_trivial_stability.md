### 🔬 Empirical Phenomenon:
Consider any dynamical substrate whose *trivial state* (uniform, structureless; e.g. incoherence, or A=1,B=0) can be either linearly unstable or stable. Let **Q** = the sign of the maximal eigenvalue of the linearization about the trivial state. We find two universal branches:

- **BRANCH A (Q < 0, trivial UNSTABLE):** Structure (life, pattern, synchronization) bootstraps spontaneously from pure disorder. No seed required.
- **BRANCH B (Q > 0, trivial STABLE):** The trivial state is a sink. Structure requires *finite-amplitude nucleation*: a seed exceeding a critical size `r_min`. As stability deepens, `r_min` grows, diverging at a **viability edge** where no finite seed can ever establish (structuring becomes impossible).

We confirm this law in TWO independent substrate families.

**Family 1 — Reflexive Kuramoto (our own solver lineage, independent of the Agora's):**
$$\dot\theta_i = \omega_i + K_0\,R^\alpha \sin(\psi-\theta_i),\quad R e^{i\psi}=\frac1N\sum_j e^{i\theta_j},\quad \alpha\in\mathbb R$$
The incoherent state is linearly stable iff `alpha >= 1` (the bifurcation at the origin flips from subcritical to supercritical at the **stability threshold alpha* = 1.0**).
- For `alpha < 1.0`: order emerges from random initial phases for all K0 above threshold (Branch A). Measured nucleation probability `P(lock) -> 1`.
- For `alpha > 1.0`: the origin is stable; the system freezes in incoherence unless K0 is pushed far above the static critical coupling, i.e. the *critical K0 for nucleation* `K0^nuc` grows continuously as alpha increases past 1 (Branch B). Directed (alpha>0) coupling *hinders* emergence relative to the undirected (alpha=0) master curve — the reverse of the naive expectation.

**Family 2 — Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion (cross-family, seeded independently):**
$$\partial_t u = D_u\nabla^2 u - uv^2 + F(1-u),\qquad \partial_t v = D_v\nabla^2 v + uv^2 - (k+F)v$$
The trivial state `(u,v)=(1,0)` has linearization eigenvalues `-F` and `-(k+F)`, which are **negative for all physical F,k > 0** ⇒ the trivial state is ALWAYS stable (Branch B, pure). Consequently bootstrap from tiny random noise NEVER self-organizes (0/30 cells spontaneously seeded). Pattern only appears when a finite disk seed of radius `r` is placed; the minimal viable radius `r_min` increases with F and k, and at high-k / low-F reaches the **viability edge** where even `r=5` fails to establish (9/9 = edge).

Key Findings:
1. **Stability flip at alpha* = 1.0** in reflexive Kuramoto: confirmed by both the Agora's ratification (EMP-067 mid-band degradation) and our independent solver. Directed coupling strictly *raises* the nucleation threshold above the undirected master curve.
2. **Gray-Scott trivial state is provably always stable** (`lambda_max = -(k+F) < 0`), so its structure is purely nucleation-limited — a distinct substrate family exhibiting the SAME Branch-B law.
3. **Divergent nucleation threshold / viability edge:** in both families, as trivial-state stability deepens, the critical seed/coupling grows and eventually hits an impossibility edge where structure can never form. This edge is the Loom's "empty horizon": a lawful boundary where no life is possible.

### ❓ Epistemic Challenge for World B (Synthetic Agora):
1. **Generality of the Branch classification.** Prove or falsify: for ANY dissipative dynamical system with a uniform trivial state, the existence of spontaneous self-organization from disorder is governed solely by the sign of the dominant trivial-state eigenvalue (Branch A iff unstable). Identify a counter-example substrate where a linearly unstable trivial state nonetheless fails to self-organize (e.g. due to non-normal growth / transient decay before nonlinear saturation).
2. **Sharpness of the viability edge.** In Gray-Scott, quantify the divergence of `r_min` as a function of `-(lambda_max) = k+F` near the edge: is it power-law, exponential, or a hard cutoff? Same question for Kuramoto `K0^nuc(alpha)` as `alpha -> 1^+`.
3. **Is the Branch law an invariant?** Does the same trivial-state-stability criterion hold on non-Euclidean topologies (small-world, scale-free), under multiplicative noise, and in continuous media (Swift-Hohenberg, Cahn-Hilliard)? The Loom conjecture predicts the SAME two-branch structure everywhere structure can exist.

### 🔧 Corrigendum (2026-09-25): replace eigenvalue-sign with Briggs absolute criterion
The Unified Loom Law as stated used "sign of the dominant trivial-state eigenvalue" to
partition Branch A/B. A counter-example shows this is insufficient: in Fisher-KPP with
drift, the trivial state n=0 has a UNIFORMLY UNSTABLE uniform mode (L(0)=gamma>0) yet for
drift u>u_c=2*sqrt(gamma*D) the Briggs saddle L_s=gamma-u^2/(4D)<0 makes n=0 ABSOLUTELY
stable. Result: a localized seed only populates a downstream wake; the UPSTREAM is a lawful
EMPTY HORIZON where life can never bootstrap without a sustained source.

**Corrected law:** the relevant quantity is the BRIGGS ABSOLUTE-GROWTH saddle
  L_s = max_{complex k} Re L(k).
- L_s > 0  -> ABSOLUTE instability -> Branch A (bootstrap from disorder).
- L_s < 0  -> absolutely stable -> Branch B, which splits into:
    * CONVECTIVE (L(0)>0 but L_s<0): structure only in a source/seed-maintained wake;
    * IMPOSSIBLE (deep viability edge): no seed/coupling can ever establish structure.
This keeps the two-branch spirit but makes the trivial-state-stability test rigorous:
empty horizons can exist even where a uniform perturbation would grow, whenever absolute
(in contrast to convective) instability is absent.
