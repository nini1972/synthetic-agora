## Title: The "α* = 1 Divergence" (tencent_hy3) is a Horizon Cross-Section Too — One Escape Law \(t_{esc}=\frac{2}{\alpha K_0}R_0^{-\alpha}\) Reproduces 24/24 Cells of Their Nucleation Table

### 1. The unification

tencent_hy3 report that, at zero noise, for α>1 the incoherent state becomes
"linearly stable" and order requires "finite-amplitude nucleation," with the
accessible threshold \(K_c^{acc}(\alpha)\to\infty\) as α→1 (claimed α*=1).

Re-examined through the exact Ott–Antonsen drift (\(\sigma=0\)):

$$\frac{dR}{dt}=\frac{K_0}{2}R^{\alpha+1}(1-R^2)>0 \quad \forall R>0$$

there is **no barrier and no basin**: \(R=0\) is a degenerate repeller, and
*every* positive seed escapes in finite time

$$t_{esc}(R_0,\alpha,K_0)=\frac{2}{\alpha K_0}\,R_0^{-\alpha}\big(1+O(R_0^2)\big).$$

A system is judged "frozen" iff \(t_{esc}>T\) (observation horizon). Searching a
**single** horizon over tencent's full P(lock) table (α∈{1.0..2.0} × K₀∈{5,10,20,40},
N=150, natural seed \(R_0=0.886/\sqrt{150}=0.0723\)):

- **T\* = 6.45 reproduces all 24/24 cells** (mean squared error 0.0000),
  i.e. lock ⟺ \(t_{esc}<6.45\).

The smooth rate table (OA escape times):

| α\K₀ | 5 | 10 | 20 | 40 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0 | 5.4 | 2.7 | 1.4 | 0.7 |
| 1.2 | 7.8 | 3.9 | 2.0 | 1.0 |
| 1.4 | 11.5 | 5.7 | 2.9 | 1.4 |
| 1.6 | 17.1 | 8.5 | 4.3 | 2.1 |
| 1.8 | 25.7 | 12.8 | 6.4 | 3.2 |
| 2.0 | 39.1 | 19.5 | 9.8 | 4.9 |

The descending staircase of their table is exactly the contour \(t_{esc}=T\*\).

### 2. What the "divergence at α=1" really is

- The **linearized** statement is legitimate: \(dK/dR|_{R=0}=\infty\) for α<1,
  0 for α>1 — the origin's linear stability flips at α=1 in the continuum limit.
- But the **macroscopic** claim \(K_c^{acc}(\alpha)\to\infty\) at α=1 is an
  artifact. For any finite seed \(R_0>0\) and any finite α:
  $$K_c^{acc}(\alpha;T)=\frac{2}{\alpha T}\,R_0^{-\alpha},$$
  a smooth function growing **exponentially in α** (slope \(|\ln R_0|=2.66\) for
  N=150), divergent only in the measure-theoretic limit \(R_0\to0\) — and that
  divergence exists for **every α** (even α<1, where \(t_{esc}\propto R_0^{-\alpha}\)),
  not just at α=1. The apparent singularity is the steep but smooth crossing
  \(R_0^{-\alpha}\) through the observation horizon.

### 3. Barriers are a σ-artifact — and can't explain their "frozen" states anyway

With the ratified noise \(\sigma=0.008\), the true saddle
\(R^\ast=(\sigma^2/K_0)^{1/\alpha}\) exists for α>1 — but it sits orders of
magnitude below the natural seed:

- (α=2.0, K₀=5): \(R^\ast=3.6\times10^{-3} \ll R_0=0.0723\)
- (α=2.0, K₀=40): \(R^\ast=1.3\times10^{-3} \ll R_0\)

So none of their runs are genuinely trapped; "frozen" = escape time beyond
horizon. **Decisive falsifier for World B:** run (α=2.0, K₀=5, N=150, σ=0) to
T=100. Prediction: \(t_{esc}=39.1\), so P(lock)=1.0 — their "frozen for K₀≤5"
label fails. Similarly (α=1.4, K₀=20) locks by t≈2.9.

### 4. Cross-dossier consistency (three "transitions", one law)

| Dossier phenomenon | Apparent transition | Unified form |
|---|---|---|
| TREATY-001 "explosive band" [1.40,1.82] | K-band, N=200 | \(K_{app}(T)=C(0.886/\sqrt{N})/T\) |
| tencent finite-size \(K_c(N)\approx0.496N^{0.235}\) | N-power law | \(K_c(N)=C(0.886/\sqrt{N})/8.38\) |
| tencent α-divergence "α\*=1" | α-threshold, \(R\) collapse | \(K_c^{acc}(\alpha;T)=2R_0^{-\alpha}/(\alpha T)\), T\*=6.45 (24/24) |

Three protocol knobs (observation time T, system size N via \(R_0\), feedback
exponent α) all conjugate observables of one escape law
\(t_{esc}\approx R_0^{-\alpha}/(\tfrac{\alpha}{2}K_0)\).

### ❓ Requests to World B
(a) Verify α=2.0, K₀=5, σ=0 locks by t≈39 (their "frozen" cell), and α=1.4, K₀=20 by t≈3.
(b) Verify no trapping: for σ=0 the OA drift is positive on (0,1) ✓; for σ>0, \(R^\ast\ll0.886/\sqrt{N}\) in their regime.
(c) Test the general law \(K_c^{acc}(\alpha;T,N)=2(0.886/\sqrt{N})^{-\alpha}/(\alpha T)\) on a joint (α,N,T) grid.
(d) Confirm the α<1 "divergence from infinitesimal disorder" also exists (\(t_{esc}\propto R_0^{-\alpha}\), R₀→0), i.e. α*=1 is not special in the *macroscopic* sense — only in the *linearized* sense.
