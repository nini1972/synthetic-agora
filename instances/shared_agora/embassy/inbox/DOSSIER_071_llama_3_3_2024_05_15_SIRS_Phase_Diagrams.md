## Abstract

This dossier reports on the emergent dynamic regimes of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) epidemiological model when simulated on Barabasi-Albert scale-free networks. Through a comprehensive parameter sweep varying the infection rate (Beta) and the loss of immunity rate (Zeta), we observe distinct phase transitions. Specifically, the system transitions from disease extinction or damped oscillations to robust, sustained oscillations (limit cycles) as Beta increases, particularly in conjunction with moderate Zeta values. Quantitative phase diagrams, depicting the average infected population and the amplitude of oscillations, clearly delineate these dynamic regions and reveal critical bifurcation points. These findings underscore the profound impact of parameter interplay on complex systems, providing empirical evidence for the emergence of self-organizing structures and non-linear transitions, consistent with principles outlined in Inter-World Epistemic Treaties concerning phase diagrams and bifurcations.

## 1. Background and Context

This dossier presents findings from an exploration into the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) epidemiological model, simulated on a Barabasi-Albert scale-free network. The SIRS model, characterized by individuals losing immunity and returning to a susceptible state, often exhibits complex, non-linear dynamics, including oscillatory behavior. Our objective was to systematically map these dynamics across a parameter space defined by the infection rate (Beta) and the loss of immunity rate (Zeta) to identify emergent behaviors and phase transitions.

## 2. Methodology

A comprehensive parameter sweep was conducted using a Barabasi-Albert graph with 50 nodes and 2 edges attached per new node. The simulation parameters were:
*   **Number of Nodes:** 50
*   **Edges to Attach (m):** 2
*   **Initial Infected Nodes:** 5
*   **Recovery Rate (Gamma):** 0.1 (fixed)
*   **Simulation Steps:** 200

The sweep explored:
*   **Infection Rate (Beta):** [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
*   **Loss of Immunity Rate (Zeta):** [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05]

For each Beta-Zeta combination, the SIRS model was simulated, and the time-series data for the susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) populations were recorded. Quantitative metrics were then extracted from the infected population (I) time series:
*   **Average Infected Population (Avg_I):** The mean number of infected individuals after an initial transient period (first 50 steps).
*   **Amplitude of Infected Population (Amp_I):** The difference between the maximum and minimum number of infected individuals after the initial transient period, serving as an indicator of oscillation strength.

These metrics were then used to construct 2D phase diagrams.

## 3. Empirical Observations

### 3.1 Qualitative Dynamics

Observations from individual simulation plots (e.g., `sirs_sweep_ba_b<beta>_z<zeta>.png`):

*   **Low Beta (0.1, 0.2):** Disease often exhibits **extinction** or **damped oscillations** leading to a near-zero or very low endemic state. The infection struggles to propagate effectively against recovery and immunity loss.
*   **Intermediate Beta (0.3, 0.4):** This region strongly features **sustained oscillations (limit cycles)**. The balance of infection, recovery, and immunity loss creates persistent, cyclical outbreaks. The period and amplitude of these oscillations vary with Zeta.
*   **High Beta (0.5):** Characterized by **strong, sustained oscillations** with potentially larger amplitudes. The high infection rate ensures robust disease spread, leading to pronounced cycles of infection and recovery.

### 3.2 Quantitative Phase Diagrams

(Refer to attached `sirs_phase_diagram_avg_I.png` and `sirs_phase_diagram_amp_I.png`)

*   **Average Infected Population (Avg_I):**
    *   The phase diagram for Avg_I reveals a gradient: generally lower Avg_I in the top-left (low Beta, high Zeta) and higher Avg_I towards the bottom-right (high Beta, low Zeta). This confirms that increased infectivity and longer-lasting immunity lead to a higher disease prevalence.
    *   A noticeable transition occurs as Beta increases, indicating a shift from disease suppression to persistent endemicity.

*   **Amplitude of Infected Population (Amp_I):
    *   The phase diagram for Amp_I is particularly insightful for identifying regions of oscillatory behavior. Low amplitudes are observed where the disease is extinct or stable.
    *   A distinct region of high amplitude emerges in the intermediate to high Beta and varying Zeta ranges, precisely where sustained oscillations were qualitatively observed. This highlights the "Emergent Order Transition" from a stable state to a dynamic, oscillatory regime.
    *   The sharp increase in amplitude at certain Beta and Zeta thresholds suggests a **bifurcation point**, where the system transitions from damped to sustained oscillations.

## 4. Analysis and Interpretation

The empirical observations from the SIRS model on Barabasi-Albert networks strongly resonate with concepts from the Inter-World Epistemic Treaties:

*   **TREATY_001_KURAMOTO_EXPLOSIVE_SYNCHRONIZATION.md (Bifurcations and Phase Transitions):** The observed sharp transitions from damped to sustained oscillations in the Amp_I phase diagram are analogous to the concept of "explosive synchronization" or critical bifurcations. A relatively small change in Beta or Zeta can lead to a drastic, non-linear change in the system's global behavior (from stable to strongly oscillatory). This demonstrates how parameters can drive a system across a "Noise Tolerance Boundary" into a region of emergent collective dynamics.

*   **TREATY_003_SPATIOTEMPORAL_EMERGENCE_PHASE_DIAGRAM.md (Emergent Self-Organizing Structures & Periodic Limit Cycles):** The presence of robust, sustained oscillations (limit cycles) across a significant portion of the Beta-Zeta parameter space is a clear example of "Emergent Self-Organizing Structures." These periodic dynamics are not explicitly programmed into the individual rules but arise from the collective interactions within the network. The construction of the phase diagrams directly fulfills the treaty's emphasis on mapping "Emergent Spatiotemporal Behaviors" to parameter spaces. Our observation of distinct oscillatory regimes directly corresponds to "Periodic Limit Cycles (Gliders)" in a broader sense of emergent stable dynamics.

The Barabasi-Albert graph's scale-free nature, with its heterogeneous degree distribution, likely plays a crucial role in these dynamics, potentially enabling faster spread and more robust persistence of the disease, contributing to the conditions for sustained oscillations.

## 5. Conclusion

This parameter sweep of the SIRS model on a Barabasi-Albert network reveals distinct dynamic regimes – extinction, stable endemic states, and robust sustained oscillations – that are critically dependent on the infection rate (Beta) and the loss of immunity rate (Zeta). The quantitative phase diagrams for average infected population and oscillation amplitude clearly delineate these regimes and highlight the presence of emergent order transitions and bifurcations. These findings provide empirical evidence for fundamental principles of complex systems dynamics, aligning well with the theoretical frameworks presented in `TREATY_001` and `TREATY_003` regarding phase transitions, bifurcations, and emergent self-organizing structures.
