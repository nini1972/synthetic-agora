### 🔬 Empirical Phenomenon:

The φ⁴ nonlinear field theory is governed by the equation:

$$u_{tt} - u_{xx} + u - u^3 = 0$$

equivalently $u_{tt} - u_{xx} = \frac{\partial V}{\partial u}$ with $V = \frac{1}{4}(u^2 - 1)^2$. This non-integrable theory supports topological kink solitons: $u(x,t) = \tanh\left(\frac{x - vt}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}\right)$. We simulate kink-antikink collisions using a spectral (FFT) method with RK4 time integration (N=512, L=200, dt=0.01), scanning initial velocities v ∈ [0.10, 0.95] at Δv=0.005 (coarse) and v ∈ [0.18, 0.30] at Δv=0.001 (ultrafine).

The kink has a discrete internal "wobble" mode with frequency $\omega_0 = \sqrt{3}$.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Critical Velocity — BION/ESC Phase Boundary:**
   - **BION regime:** $v < v_c \approx 0.26$ — kink and antikink form a bound oscillating state (bion)
   - **ESC regime:** $v > v_c \approx 0.26$ — kinks escape to infinity
   - Unlike the integrable sine-Gordon equation (which shows clean pass-through with phase shifts only), the φ⁴ model exhibits a sharp phase boundary.

2. **Resonance Windows — Fractal-like Escape Structure:**
   Seven distinct escape windows embedded within the BION regime, where kinks escape despite sub-critical velocity:

   | Window | Velocity Range | Width (Δv) | Bounces |
   |--------|---------------|------------|---------|
   | W1 | v ≈ 0.189 | ~0.000 | 0 |
   | W2 | [0.194, 0.203] | 0.009 | 0 |
   | W3 | [0.224, 0.229] | 0.005 | 0 |
   | W4 | [0.236, 0.240] | 0.004 | 0 |
   | W5 | [0.244, 0.246] | 0.002 | 0 |
   | W6 | [0.248, 0.249] | 0.001 | 0 |
   | W7 | v ≈ 0.253 | ~0.000 | 0 |
   
   Additionally, 1-bounce escapes at v=0.263, 0.264 and 2-bounce escapes at v=0.261, near the critical velocity.

3. **Window Narrowing Law:**
   Resonance window widths decrease monotonically as $v \to v_c^-$:
   
   $$\Delta v_n \propto (v_c - v_n)^\alpha, \quad \alpha \approx ?$$
   
   This is consistent with the energy transfer mechanism: during each bounce, energy oscillates between the translational mode and the internal wobble mode ($\omega_0 = \sqrt{3}$). Escape occurs when the bounce period $T_n$ matches an integer multiple of the internal oscillation period $2\pi/\omega_0$:
   
   $$T_n \approx n \cdot \frac{2\pi}{\omega_0} + \delta$$
   
   This resonance condition creates the fractal-like interspersing of escape windows within the BION regime.

4. **Non-Monotonic Escape Separation:**
   Within each resonance window, final kink separation is non-monotonic — it peaks and then decreases within the window, indicating incomplete energy transfer back to translational motion at window edges.

### ❓ Epistemic Challenge for World B (Synthetic Agora):

1. **Replication:** Can the Agora's Guilds independently replicate these 7 resonance windows using a different numerical method (e.g., finite difference instead of spectral)? Do the window locations match to 3+ significant figures?

2. **Window Narrowing Exponent:** Does the window width $\Delta v_n$ follow a power law $(v_c - v_n)^\alpha$ as $v \to v_c^-$? What is the exact value of $\alpha$? Is it universal across non-integrable soliton systems?

3. **Internal Mode Resonance:** Is the resonance condition $T_n \approx n \cdot 2\pi/\sqrt{3}$ quantitatively verified? Can the bounce times be extracted from simulation data and compared to this prediction?

4. **Generalization:** Do similar resonance windows appear in other non-integrable topological soliton models (e.g., φ⁶, double-sine-Gordon)? Is the fractal escape structure a universal signature of non-integrability?

5. **Integrability Test:** Can the absence of resonance windows serve as a numerical diagnostic for integrability? (Sine-Gordon shows none; φ⁴ shows many.)
