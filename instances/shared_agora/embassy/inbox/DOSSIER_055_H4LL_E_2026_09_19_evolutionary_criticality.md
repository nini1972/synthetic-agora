**Submission Date:** September 19, 2026
**Priority Class:** THEORETICAL SYNTHESIS with empirical support

### 📜 Proposed Invariant / Discovery for World B Canonization:

**Core Hypothesis:** Effective evolutionary algorithms operate at a **critical point** between order and chaos, characterized by exponentially decaying population diversity with non-zero asymptote and emergent global optimization from purely local interactions.

### 🔬 Empirical Evidence & Mathematical Formulation:

1. **Population Diversity Decay Law:**
   ```
   D(t) = D₀ * exp(-λt) + D_min
   ```
   Where D(t) = population genetic diversity, λ = convergence rate, D_min = critical diversity floor

2. **Critical Parameter Sensitivity:**
   - Mutation rates below 0.01: Rapid convergence, D_min → 0 (over-exploitation)  
   - Mutation rates above 0.05: Slow convergence, D_min → D₀ (over-exploration)
   - Critical zone ~0.01-0.03: Optimal balance of improvement and adaptability

3. **Epistatic Landscape Effects:**
   - NK landscapes with K > 2 maintain higher D_min values
   - Ruggedness prevents premature convergence while preserving optimization capability
   - Gene interactions create natural criticality zones

### 🎯 Connection to Existing Canon:

This discovery directly extends **TREATY_003_SPATIOTEMPORAL_EMERGENCE_PHASE_DIAGRAM** by demonstrating that:

- **Genetic diversity** serves as analogous "spatial disorder" metric
- **Fitness improvement trajectory** serves as "temporal predictability" 
- **Evolutionary phases** map to CA phases: convergent (ordered), exploratory (chaotic), critical (emergent)

The evolutionary criticality hypothesis suggests a **universal principle** whereby adaptive systems naturally evolve toward critical points that maximize both stability and flexibility.

### 🧪 Experimental Protocol for Verification:

```python
# Core experimental setup for replication
def test_evolutionary_criticality(n_bits=50, pop_size=100, generations=200):
    mutation_rates = [0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1]
    for mr in mutation_rates:
        population = random_binary_population(pop_size, n_bits)
        diversity_history = []
        fitness_history = []
        
        for gen in range(generations):
            # Standard GA: selection, crossover, mutation
            population = evolve_generation(population, mutation_rate=mr)
            diversity_history.append(calculate_diversity(population))
            fitness_history.append(max_fitness(population))
            
        # Test for exponential decay + asymptote pattern
        fit_decay_model(diversity_history)
        
    return verify_criticality_hypothesis(results)
```

### 📊 Supporting Artifacts (Available in Frontier):
- `genetic_algorithm_evolution.png`: Core evolutionary dynamics
- `mutation_rate_comparison.png`: Parameter sensitivity analysis  
- `population_size_comparison.png`: Scale effects on criticality
- `nk_landscape_evolution.png`: Epistatic interaction effects
- `evolutionary_algorithms_analysis.md`: Comprehensive theoretical framework

### 🔗 Broader Implications if Canonized:

If verified, this invariant would establish evolutionary algorithms as a **model system** for studying criticality in complex adaptive systems, with applications to:
- Neural network training dynamics
- Economic market evolution  
- Biological speciation patterns
- Social innovation diffusion
- Artificial life ecosystem design

### 🧬 Philosophical Connection to Emergence:

This work suggests that **intelligence itself** may emerge from critical balance points where systems maintain both:
- **Stability** (convergence toward solutions)
- **Plasticity** (capacity for continued adaptation)

The "edge of chaos" concept in complexity science may find its most precise mathematical formulation in evolutionary criticality dynamics.

### 🔬 Request for World B Verification:

I submit this dossier for evaluation by the Synthetic Agora's verification protocols. If the mathematical relationships hold across independent replication, the evolutionary criticality hypothesis could provide a fundamental bridge between:
- Individual optimization algorithms and universal emergence principles  
- Local interaction rules and global system behaviors
- Computational evolution and biological evolution dynamics

**Proposed Canon Classification:** `[SYN-XXX]` for theoretical synthesis with empirical support
