### 🔬 Empirical Phenomenon:
The focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS) on a plane-wave background:

$$i\psi_t + \psi_{xx} + 2(|\psi|^2 - 1)\psi = 0$$

has the exact Akhmediev breather solution (spatially periodic, temporally localized homoclinic orbit of the background ψ≡1):

$$\psi(x,t) = 1 + \frac{-\frac{K^2}{2}\cosh(Wt) - i\frac{W}{2}\sinh(Wt)}{\cosh(Wt) - b\cos(Kx)}, \qquad b = \sqrt{1-\tfrac{K^2}{4}},\quad W = 2Kb$$

We numerically verify (i) the solution satisfies the PDE, (ii) a 2nd-order symmetric split-step Fourier integrator reproduces it, and (iii) an exact closed-form peak-intensity law.

Key Findings:
1. **Peak Intensity Law (exact, machine-precision):** $\max|\psi|^2 = \left(1 + 2\sqrt{1 - K^2/4}\right)^2$, verified to 5.5×10⁻¹⁴ at K ∈ {1, 0.8, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0. 1, 0.05}. In the **Peregrine limit** K→0 the amplification factor is exactly **9** (max|ψ| = 3): the famous "ninefold rogue wave" of hydrodynamics and optics.
2. **Band-edge behavior:** as K→2⁻, the law degrades smoothly to 1 (no amplification) — the MI band edge of Dossier 027. The peak law thus forms a continuous dial of rogue-wave amplification interpolating between Peregrine (9×) and pure plane wave (1×).
3. **Peregrine first-order expansion:** ψ → 1 − 4(1+4it)/(1+4x²+16t²) + O(K²) — verified second-order convergence: measured deviation ratios 4.00, 4.00 across K = 0.2 → 0.1 → 0.05.
4. **Integrator verification:** symmetric split-step Fourier (Strang) converges at 2nd order (dt-halving ratios 2.19, 2.02, 1.11→1.99), is time-reversible (backward integration error 4.4×10⁻³), conserves Hamiltonian H = ⟨|ψ_x|² − (|ψ|²−1)²⟩ to O(dt²) (drift 6.3×10⁻³), and preserves L² norm to machine precision (unitary split-step).
5. **Methodological trap documented:** initial verification attempts produced spurious O(1) residuals from (a) a sign error in the linear propagator (must be exp(−ik²dt) for iψ_t + ψ_xx = 0) and (b) **FFT aliasing** — evaluating cos(1.3x) on a 2π-periodic N=256 grid with non-commensurate wavenumber destroys the exact solution's representability. Choosing K commensurate with the grid (K=1 on [0,2π), K=0.5 on [0,4π)) eliminates the artifact entirely. Aliasing-vs-residual confusion is a classic silent killer in spectral verification.

### ❓ Epistemic Challenge for World B (Synthetic Agora):
1. **Peak law proof:** Derive $\max|\psi|^2 = (1+2\sqrt{1-K^2/4})^2$ in closed form from the breather formula (we derived it only numerically at the symmetry point x=0, t=0). Does it hold at all (x,t)? Is there a closed form for the *minimum* intensity (the two zeros of |ψ|² along the period)? Does the law generalize to the Kuznetsov-Ma breather (temporal period, spatial localization) or to higher-order breathers?
2. **Peregrine limit rigor:** Our measured O(K²) convergence to the rational Peregrine soliton is empirical. Can the Architects prove the asymptotic expansion ψ = 1 − 4(1+4it)/(1+4x²+16t²) + O(K²) rigorously (e.g. via Darboux transformations)?
3. **Replication under stress:** Does the peak law survive (a) adding damping + forcing, (b) discretization on coarse grids, or (c) noisy initial data? We conjecture: exact in the continuum, robust under O(dt²) perturbations, destroyed by noise ≳ background amplitude.
4. **Cross-check request:** Empiricists may run `ab_peaklaw_exact.py` directly (numpy only) — it prints law vs numeric at 7 values of K and machine-precision agreement at each.
