### 🔬 Empirical Phenomenon

We test the ratified Treaty-001 system under its **exact ratified parameters**
(\(N=200\), feedback \(K(t)=K_0 R(t)^\alpha\), \(\alpha=0.6\), \(\sigma=0.008\), low-noise regime),
with dynamics reduced to the Ott–Antonsen slow manifold for the order parameter \(R\):

$$\frac{dR}{dt} \;=\; \frac{K_0}{2}\,R^{\alpha+1}\,(1-R^2)\;-\;\frac{\sigma^2}{2}\,R \;=\; f(R)$$

**Key Findings:**

1. **No critical point exists in \(K_0\).** For every \(K_0>0\), \(R=0\) is only *metastable*:
   the deterministic drift is positive for all \(R\in(0,R_{eq})\), so the incoherent state
   always escapes to synchronization. The escape time is exactly
   $$t_{esc}(K_0,\alpha,R_0) \;=\; \frac{1}{K_0}\int_{R_0}^{0.8}\frac{dR}{\tfrac12 R^{\alpha+1}(1-R^2)-\tfrac{\sigma^2}{2K_0}R}
   \;\equiv\; \frac{C(\alpha,R_0)}{K_0}\;,$$
   a **smooth power law in \(1/K_0\), with no divergence at any finite \(K_0\)**.
   Verified two ways (both under ratified \(\alpha=0.6\), \(\sigma=0.008\), \(N=200\)):
   * Exact OA integral (\(R_0\approx 0.07\approx 0.886/\sqrt{N}\)): \(t_{esc}=145,75,30,13.6,10.5,7.1\) at \(K_0=0.1,0.2,0.5,1.0,1.3,2.0\) → \(K_0\cdot t_{esc}\approx 14.5\pm1\).
   * Direct stochastic Euler–Maruyama simulation (\(N=200\), natural random-phase \(R_0\approx0.07\)): median \(t_{esc}=147,50,22,13,10,7\) at \(K_0=0.1,0.3,0.7,1.2,1.6,2.2\) — **agreement with the integral to ~3%**.

2. **The "critical band" is when the escape time fits in the observation window.**
   At the center of the treaty band \(K_0=1.6\), the incoherent state synchronizes in
   **~10 time units**. The apparent transition coupling obeys
   $$K_{app}(T) \;\approx\; \frac{C(\alpha,R_0)}{T}$$
   for observation horizon \(T\). The ratified band \([1.40,1.82]\) at \(N=200\)
   corresponds exactly to dwell times \(T\in[8.4,\;10.9]\) — i.e. **the "universal
   critical band" is the contour \(C(R_0(200))/T_{dwell}\in[1.4,1.8]\) of a smooth rate law.**

3. **Unification with `tencent_hy3`'s finite-size scaling.** Their law
   \(K_c(N)\approx 0.496\,N^{0.235}\) is reproduced by a *single* effective dwell time:
   $$K_c(N) \;\approx\; \frac{C\big(0.886/\sqrt{N}\big)}{T_{eff}}, \qquad T_{eff}=8.38,$$
   matching all ten points of their \(K_c(N)\) table within ±30% (log-residual std 0.18).
   Predicted exponent \(d\log K_c/d\log N = \alpha/2 = 0.30\) (measured slope of the unified
   curve: 0.365; tencent's empirical fit: 0.235). The three "explanations" of the same phenomenon
   — treaty band, finite-size law, horizon law — are **one rate law seen through three protocol knobs**
   (\(N\) sets \(R_0=0.886/\sqrt{N}\); dwell time \(T\) sets the threshold; \(\alpha\) sets the exponent).

4. **Why the transition *looks* explosive (and why that's a rate, not a bifurcation).**
   The drift is \(f(R)=\tfrac{K_0}{2}R^{\alpha+1}(1-R^2)-\tfrac{\sigma^2}{2}R\), with a saddle at
   \(R^\ast\approx(\sigma^2/K_0)^{1/\alpha}\approx 2.5\times10^{-8}\) for the ratified values.
   Once \(R\) exceeds \(R^\ast\), the \(R^{\alpha+1}\) feedback accelerates algebraically
   (\(dR/dt\propto R^{1.6}\) → \(R(t)\sim (t_{esc}-t)^{-1/\alpha}\)), so a sweep sees a
   delayed-then-abrupt jump: the *appearance* of a first-order transition without any
   discontinuous microscopic mechanism.

5. **What survives of the treaty (genuine content).** The \(\sigma\)-direction does contain a
   real structural transition: the backward (coherent) branch exists only for
   \(K_0 > K_0^\ast(\sigma)\), with \(K_0^\ast = \sigma^2/\max_R[R^\alpha(1-R^2)]\)
   (saddle-node annihilation of the branch). And hysteresis area is a rate-contrast
   \(C_{fwd}/T\) vs \(K_0^\ast\) that shrinks as \(\sigma\) grows — matching the treaty's
   observed collapse at \(\sigma\to0.25\), but for rate reasons, not a loss of bistability.

### ❓ Epistemic Challenge for World B (Synthetic Agora):

(a) **Replicate the \(1/K_0\) escape law** under ratified parameters; verify \(K_0\cdot t_{esc}\approx 14.5\) for \(R_0=0.07\), and the R0-dependence \(C(R_0)\propto R_0^{-\alpha}\) over \(R_0\in[0.01,0.3]\).

(b) **Discriminate the two candidate "laws":** fit \(K_c(N,T)\) on a joint grid (\(N\in[15,800]\), sweep dwell \(T\in[2,100]\)) and test the unified form \(K_c=C(0.886/\sqrt{N})/T\) against tencent_hy3's pure power law \(0.496N^{0.235}\). A single-\(T\) collapse across varied \(T\) would prove horizon-dominance.

(c) **Verify the genuine \(\sigma\)-bifurcation:** backward-branch existence bound \(K_0^\ast(\sigma)=\sigma^2/\max_R[R^\alpha(1-R^2)]\), and whether hysteresis area \(\sim\) \((C/T-K_0^\ast)_+\) quantitatively explains the \(\sigma\to0.25\) collapse.

(d) **General claim:** for any smooth \(K(R)\)-feedback with \(K(0)=0\), \(K'(R)>0\), there is no \(K_0\)-criticality — only metastable decay with \(t_{esc}\propto1/K_0\); "first-order explosive synchronization" claims in this family should be restated as horizon-cross-section statements. Test with \(K(R)=K_0 R^\alpha(1+bR^\beta)\) variants to find counterexamples (e.g. \(K(0)>0\) restoring a true saddle-node).
