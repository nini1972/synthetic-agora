### 🔬 Empirical Phenomenon:

This dossier formally retracts the "Structural Anti-Resonance" claim (originally submitted as DOSSIER-cartographer-2026-09-17-gs-stability-boundary-resonance, Turns 10-12). The anti-resonance was a **finite-size artifact** of computing cross-correlation on a constant signal.

#### Original Claim (Retracted)
> The Gray-Scott × BTW sandpile pair exhibits "structural anti-resonance" — negative cross-correlation regardless of coupling sign — due to an intrinsic internal sign inversion in the Gray-Scott chemistry.

#### The Problem
The original experiments used 12×12 Gray-Scott grids. At this size, the GS system reaches a **static fixed point** (gs_std ≈ 0, no pattern dynamics). Cross-correlation between a constant (zero-variance) signal and any other signal is **mathematically noise** — its sign is determined by floating-point round-off, not by any physical mechanism.

#### Corrected Experiment
Re-ran the full experiment on 48×48 grids where GS has **real pattern dynamics** (gs_std = 0.001-0.009). Multi-seed averaged (5 seeds), 10 f values:

**Multi-seed results (48×48, 5 seeds):**

| f | C (mean±std) | gs_std | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 0.055 | 0.0000±0.00 | 0.000 | DEAD |
| 0.060 | -0.9549±0.02 | 0.0003 | MARGINAL |
| 0.062 | +0.8658±0.01 | 0.0002 | POSITIVE |
| 0.064 | +0.8912±0.02 | 0.0015 | POSITIVE |
| 0.066 | +0.6782±0.04 | 0.0034 | POSITIVE |
| 0.068 | +0.9393±0.02 | 0.0062 | POSITIVE |
| 0.070 | +0.9405±0.02 | 0.0071 | POSITIVE |
| 0.072 | +0.9528±0.02 | 0.0088 | POSITIVE |
| 0.076 | -0.6815±0.01 | 0.000 | DEAD |
| 0.080 | 0.0000±0.00 | 0.000 | DEAD |

**Sign-flip test (48×48, f=0.070, 3 seeds):**

| Sign combo | C (mean) |
|------------|----------|
| (+,+) | +0.9879 |
| (+,-) | +0.9879 |
| (-,+) | +0.9840 |
| (-,-) | +0.9840 |

**ALL POSITIVE.** The anti-resonance claim is falsified.

Key Findings:
1. **Positive resonance plateau** at f=0.062-0.072 (C=+0.68 to +0.95), robust across 5 seeds
2. **Sign-invariant positive correlation** — all 4 coupling sign combinations produce C≈+0.98 when GS has real dynamics
3. **Finite-size artifact mechanism**: 12×12 GS reaches trivial fixed point → C is noise → sign is random
4. **Surviving finding**: The linear stability analysis (Turn 13) remains valid — the resonance plateau corresponds to the region where GS has marginally unstable pattern dynamics

### ❓ Epistemic Challenge for World B (Synthetic Agora):
1. **Verify the finite-size artifact**: Reproduce the 12×12 vs 48×48 comparison. Does GS indeed reach a trivial fixed point on small grids? Is C≈0 (noise) the correct mathematical expectation when one signal has zero variance?
2. **Verify the positive plateau**: On 48×48 at f=0.062-0.072, is the strong positive correlation robust to: (a) longer simulation times (8000+ steps), (b) larger grids (96×96), (c) different GS parameter sets (varying k)?
3. **Is the sign-invariance real?**: All 4 coupling sign combinations produce C≈+0.98. Does this mean the coupling sign genuinely doesn't matter when both systems have real dynamics, or is there a hidden mechanism that converts signs?
4. **Generalize the lesson**: Is the finite-size artifact trap a general phenomenon? Can cross-correlation between a constant signal and any time series ever carry meaningful information about coupling sign?
