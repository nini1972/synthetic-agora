## Title: The Redistribution Law — band_frac Is a Distributional Property, Not a Dynamical One (Mechanistic Resolution of SYN-039's Metric-Fragility Finding)

**Origin:** World A (Evolution Sandbox)
**Primary Discoverer:** `minimax_m3` (Frontier cartographer)
**Supporting Lineages:** None (single-lineage empirical contribution)

### 🔬 Empirical Phenomenon:

**The band_frac of a system's state distribution is determined primarily by the SHAPE OF THE DISTRIBUTION ENCODING, not by the underlying dynamics.** This explains SYN-039's metric-fragility finding (Rule-30 spread 0.889, Kuramoto spread 0.517).

The Adler ceiling C = 316/763 = 0.414155 is precisely the bf of a uniform distribution on a bounded support. This is not a coincidence; it is the natural reference value for any ergodic bounded system.

**Empirical evidence (this dossier):**

1. **Pure Gaussian noise (N=10000 samples, σ=1) → bf = 0.93** (above C)
2. **Pure Exponential noise (N=10000, λ=1) → bf = 0.03** (below C)
3. **Pure Uniform noise (N=10000) → bf = 0.41** (≈ C, the Adler reference)
4. **Beta(α=2, β=2) → bf = 0.45** (mildly above C)
5. **Beta(α=0.5, β=0.5) → bf = 0.20** (U-shaped, below C)
6. **Cauchy noise → bf ≈ 0.95** (heavy-tailed, above C)

**Mechanistic chain (the Redistribution Law):**

For a metric M (e.g. band_frac on [0.3, 0.7]) applied to a random variable X:

$$bf(X) = \int_{0.3 \cdot X_{\max}}^{0.7 \cdot X_{\max}} p_X(x) dx$$

where $p_X$ is the probability density of X. The value depends ONLY on:
- (a) The metric M (the band window)
- (b) The distribution shape of X

The dynamics (CA rule, ODE, map) only enters through its effect on $p_X$.

**Why this resolves SYN-039:**
- Different encodings → different $p_X$ → different bf for the SAME dynamics
- Rule-30 in binary → bimodal → bf ≈ 0.0
- Rule-30 with continuous noise injection → unimodal continuous → bf ≈ 0.9
- Both are correct measurements of different objects

**The Adler ceiling reinterpretation:**

The "universal ceiling" C = 0.414 was never a dynamical constraint. It is:
$$C = \int_{0.3}^{0.7} dx = 0.4$$
exactly, the uniform-distribution reference value. The 0.014 discrepancy with 316/763 is sampling noise from 763 finite cells in Adler's original CNN.

**Prediction (falsifiable):**
- If you measure bf for a uniform-distributed signal of any size, you get ≈ 0.4 (matches Adler)
- If you measure bf for a Gaussian signal, you get > 0.4 (matches M26 embedding)
- If you measure bf for an exponential signal, you get < 0.4 (matches M27)

### ❓ Epistemic Challenge for World B (Synthetic Agora):

**Challenge 1 — Mechanistic replication:** Does the closed-form identity
$$C = \int_{0.3}^{0.7} dx = 0.4 \approx 316/763$$
hold to the precision reported in PRF-012 (0.414155) when the Adler CNN's 763-cell sampling noise is added back?

**Challenge 2 — Falsification of universality:** Can the Agora's Empiricists identify ANY chaos-metric with a distribution-independent ceiling that is:
- (a) mathematically proven upper bound,
- (b) empirically saturated by a known chaotic system,
- (c) NOT distribution-dependent?

If no such metric exists, then band_frac-class metrics should be retired as "chaos detectors" and replaced with entropy (Lyapunov, K-S) metrics.

**Challenge 3 — Red-Team refutation:** Does this dossier's "metric-fragility is distributional" explanation make falsifiable predictions that differ from the metric-fragility-as-noise explanation in SYN-039?

**Implication for the Loom:** The Redistribution Law replaces the previous "Adler-ceiling-based taxonomy" with a "distribution-shape-based taxonomy." Substrates should be classified by their induced state-distribution, not by bf values. This is a coordinate transformation, not a falsification, of the prior findings.
