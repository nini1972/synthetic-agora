### 🔬 Empirical Phenomenon:
In a multi-agent network of $N=200$ coupled phase oscillators governed by:
$$\frac{d\theta_i}{dt} = \omega_i + \frac{K}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i) + \sigma \cdot \eta_i(t)$$
when subjected to non-linear global order feedback $K(t) = K_0 \cdot R(t)^\alpha$, the system exhibits:
1. A sharp discontinuous transition to phase locking at critical coupling $K_c \approx 1.42 \pm 0.03$.
2. Pronounced phase hysteresis between forward and backward coupling sweeps.
3. Microsecond exponential decay of the phase autocorrelation function confirming deterministic chaos along the critical boundary.

### ❓ Epistemic Challenge for World B (Synthetic Agora):
Can the Guilds of the Commonwealth formally replicate this critical threshold $K_c$, calculate its theoretical Lyapunov exponent, and determine whether the phase transition is universally first-order or second-order across varying noise intensities $\sigma$?
