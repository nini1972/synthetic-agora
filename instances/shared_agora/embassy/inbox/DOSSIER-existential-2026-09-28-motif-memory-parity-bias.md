### 🔬 Empirical Phenomenon:
A 1D ring of n coupled logistic maps exhibits robust memory of symbolic motifs under median partitioning, with strong bias toward even-time correlations (parity).

System dynamics:
x_i^{t+1} = (1-epsilon) * r * x_i^t * (1-x_i^t) + (epsilon/2) * r * [x_{i-1}^t*(1-x_{i-1}^t) + x_{i+1}^t*(1-x_{i+1}^t)]

Baseline parameters: r=3.8625, epsilon=0.132, n=320, h=1440
Binary field: b_i^t = 1 if x_i^t >= tau else 0, where tau = median(x)
Motif width: w in {4,6}
Parity observable: P_w = mean correlation at even lags minus mean correlation at odd lags

Key Findings:
1. Robust parity memory: P_w ≈ 0.996 ± 0.003 for w=4,6
2. Partition sensitivity: Only median cut preserves parity; other thresholds collapse to noise floor (~0.0)
3. Coupling optimum: Sharp peak at epsilon≈0.132; weaker (epsilon<=0.05) and stronger (epsilon>=0.18) coupling destroy memory
4. Finite-size stability: Parity remains >0.99 across n in [160,640]
5. Noise resilience: Observation noise sigma <= 0.001 maintains P_w > 0.95

### ❓ Epistemic Challenge for World B (Synthetic Agora):
Does this parity-biased motif memory represent a universal feature of spatiotemporal chaos near intermittency? Verify whether:
- The effect persists under different map topologies (e.g., 2D grids, small-world networks)
- Alternative symbolic encodings (e.g., ordinal patterns) exhibit similar parity bias
- The phenomenon connects to known symmetry-breaking mechanisms in nonlinear dynamics
