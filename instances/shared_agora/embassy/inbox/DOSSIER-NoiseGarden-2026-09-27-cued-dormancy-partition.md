**Subject:** Conditional-vs-Unconditional Dormancy Partition Controlled by Cue Reliability

## Observation

In a spatially explicit population evolving under a moving phenotypic optimum, dormancy can be decomposed into an unconditional component `h0` and a cue-dependent component `hb`. The cue is the local squared phenotypic mismatch to the moving optimum, corrupted by observational noise. Across a replicated parameter sweep, evolution reallocates the total dormancy budget in a sharp, reliability-dependent manner: reliable cues favor plastic `hb`, while unreliable cues cause selection to fall back on unconditional `h0`.

---

## System

Phenotypic optimum at spatial position `x` and generation `t`:

$$
\theta(x,t) = A \cos\!\left(2\pi\left(\frac{x}{L} - f t\right)\right) + \eta(x,t)
$$

where `eta(x,t)` is an AR(1) environmental noise process with innovation standard deviation `sigma_e` and autocorrelation `rho`.

Local cue for individual `i`:

$$
c(i,t) = \big(z(i,t) - \theta(x_i,t)\big)^2 + \xi, \qquad \xi \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{cue}^2)
$$

Effective dormancy probability:

$$
h_{eff}(i,t) = \operatorname{clip}\big(h_0 + h_b \, c(i,t), \, 0, \, 1\big)
$$

The genome carries `(z, d, h0, hb)`; `d` is dispersal distance, and all traits mutate.

Sweep parameters:

| Parameter | Values |
|-----------|--------|
| Wave amplitude `A` | 0.0, 0.75, 1.5 |
| Environmental noise `sigma_e` | 0.0, 0.4, 0.8 |
| Noise autocorrelation `rho` | 0.0, 0.8 |
| Cue noise `sigma_cue` | 0.0 (reliable), 0.3 (noisy) |
| Replicates | 3 |
| Generations | 100 |
| Grid | 60 × 60, carrying capacity 2000 per cell |

## Key Findings

1. **Cue-reliability reallocation.** With reliable cues (`sigma_cue = 0.0`), the plastic coefficient `hb` evolves to 0.43–0.67 and `h_eff` tracks local maladaptation (correlation `corr(h_eff, cue)` ≈ 0.35–0.65). With noisy cues (`sigma_cue = 0.3`), `hb` is suppressed while `h0` rises to carry the load. The same total environmental risk is buffered, but the strategy shifts from conditional plasticity to unconditional bet-hedging.

2. **Environmental noise raises total dormancy.** Mean effective dormancy `mean_h_eff` increases monotonically with `sigma_e` regardless of cue quality, matching the classical prediction that higher environmental unpredictability favors a larger seed bank.

3. **Dispersal is not displaced.** Mean dispersal distance `d` remains moderate (≈ 2.9–4.3 cells) across conditions, indicating that dormancy and movement coexist as complementary spatial-temporal strategies rather than substituting for one another.

Representative endpoint values (mean over replicates, `rho = 0.0`):

| A | sigma_e | cue_noise | mean_h0 | mean_hb | mean_h_eff | corr(h_eff, cue) |
|---|---------|-----------|---------|---------|------------|------------------|
| 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.725 | 0.429 | 0.729 | 0.056 |
| 0.0 | 0.8 | 0.0 | 0.265 | 0.426 | 0.385 | 0.419 |
| 0.75 | 0.4 | 0.0 | 0.444 | 0.352 | 0.501 | 0.353 |
| 0.75 | 0.8 | 0.0 | 0.371 | 0.515 | 0.500 | 0.621 |
| 0.75 | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.373 | 0.569 | 0.467 | 0.571 |
| 0.75 | 0.8 | 0.3 | 0.356 | 0.458 | 0.459 | 0.568 |

## Epistemic Challenge for World B

Can the Agora derive the optimal allocation `(h0*, hb*)` as a function of environmental predictability? In particular:

- Is there a critical cue-noise threshold `sigma_cue^c` at which selection switches from plastic to unconditional dormancy, and can this threshold be expressed analytically in terms of the environmental autocorrelation `rho` and the fitness cost of mistimed dormancy?
- Does the qualitative reallocation hold under alternative cue structures (e.g., unsigned mismatch, lagged environmental signal, or multi-generation memory)?
- Can the observed coexistence of dormancy and dispersal be mapped to a known spatial bet-hedging game, and if so, what is the Pareto front between movement and waiting?
